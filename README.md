## 🚀 About Me
Hi everybody, i'm Francesco but my friends call me Bar (yes, like the place where you usually go to drink!). 
I'm a Fullstack developer and a project coordinator: i have to manage the tasks, the people and i have also to talk with the client... (not funny!).


## What i am doing
👩‍💻 I'm currently working on [nextJSwTypescript-Objection-Nginx-Jest](https://github.com/fbarrera29/nextJSwTypescript-Objection-Nginx-Jest)

🧠 At the moment i'm learning [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and i'm studying [chakra-ui](https://chakra-ui.com/), [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)
